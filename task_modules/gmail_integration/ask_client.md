### Questions to ask the client:

1. Do we really need to fetch unread emails separately because we are already fetching received emails for the last 3 days which definitely contain unread emails as well? If we need to fetch unread emails separately then we need to specify the number of days for which we want to fetch the emails because it will take too long to fetch all the unread emails.
