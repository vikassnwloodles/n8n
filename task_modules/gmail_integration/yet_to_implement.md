Workflow Structure
1. Trigger
●​ Scheduled daily at 7:00 AM EST
2. Gmail Scan
●​ Fetch last 24h of sent mail
●​ Fetch last 72h of received mail
●​ Filter:
○​ Unread
○​ No response threads
○​ Important contacts or domains (optional)


Elaborate on "No response threads"

---------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the refined version of your workflow description with the missing step added and further polished for clarity:

---

### **Workflow Summary (Updated)**
1. **Email Retrieval**
   - Fetched sent emails from the last 24 hours
   - Fetched received emails from the last 72 hours

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Extracted only required properties from email responses
   - Added contextual metadata:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "sent"    // For sent emails
       "type": "received" // For received emails
     }
     ```

3. **Data Consolidation**
   - Merged sent and received emails into a unified list
   - Created batches to accommodate GPT token limits

4. **AI Processing**
   - Sent email batches to GPT for summarization
     - Received `n` summaries for `n` batches
   - Aggregated all summaries into a single object
   - Generated a unified morning brief from the combined summaries

### **Key Improvements**
1. Added explicit mention of property filtering
2. Maintained consistent JSON formatting for metadata
3. Improved logical grouping with clear section headers
4. Used comments in JSON snippet for better documentation
5. Kept the active voice throughout for better readability

### **Why This Matters**
The property filtering step is crucial as it:
- Reduces payload size
- Eliminates noise from unnecessary data
- Ensures GPT focuses only on relevant information

Would you like me to add any specific details about which properties were kept or how the filtering was implemented?
