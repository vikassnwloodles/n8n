1. I have created a workflow named "Gmail Integration" and successfully added all the required nodes to the workflow and it is working fine. There is some points where clarity from client is required.
2. Now I am creating calendar integration workflow.
3. We need to fetch events upcoming today so that they could be included in the morning brief to avoid missing any important event.
4. Tried fetch events upcoming today but there are not events there for today so fetching for next 2 days.
5. Now getting 7 events.
6. Exploring the events in ipynb file.
7. Removing events that are not meetings.
8. Removing unnecessary properties from json response of events.
9. Merging gmail and calendar workflows and using a single final prompt to generate morning brief.
