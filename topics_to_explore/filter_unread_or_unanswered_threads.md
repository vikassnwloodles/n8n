Great question — let me clarify the difference and guide you on which to use based on your goal:

---

### 🧩 **Your Goal: Find Unanswered Threads**

Since Gmail doesn't have a native `is:unanswered`, we use smart filters to approximate it.

---

### 🔍 Query 1:

```plaintext
is:inbox -in:chats -from:me -has:userlabels
```

**Purpose:**

* Finds emails **in your inbox**,
* That are **not chats**,
* **Not sent by you**,
* And don’t have any **user-defined labels**.

✅ **Use if:**
You want to identify potentially **unreplied or unprocessed emails**, assuming you use labels for organization.
But this can miss **unread messages** that do have labels, and it includes **read messages**, so not always the best for catching what’s truly unanswered.

---

### 🔍 Query 2:

```plaintext
is:inbox is:unread -from:me
```

**Purpose:**

* Targets **unread emails** in your inbox,
* That were **not sent by you**.

✅ **Use if:**
You want to focus on **new, likely unanswered** emails.

🟢 **This is the better choice** if your goal is to find messages that are:

* **Unread**
* **Likely waiting on your reply**

---

### ✅ Final Recommendation:

Use **this query** in your Gmail node in n8n to approximate unanswered threads:

```plaintext
is:inbox is:unread -from:me
```

It’s the most practical and clean approach for most workflows aiming to surface unhandled emails.

Would you like to add filters like "only from certain domains" or "only within the last 24 hours"?
