You are an executive assistant.
1. Scan through the following json which contains summaries of batches of emails under `emails` key and contains calendar events under `calendar` key.
```json
{{ JSON.stringify($json) }}
```
2. Let's call this json `all_data`. Wherever I will mention `all_data` within sigle back ticks, I would be referring to the above json.
3. Use `all_data` and Create a Slack-ready morning brief including Top 5 action items (with rationale) using the following template:

[[Template Begins]]
🌤️ **Morning Brief – [DATE]**

---

🧩 **Top 5 Action Items**  
1. [Action Item 1] – _[Rationale]_  
2. [Action Item 2] – _[Rationale]_  
3. [Action Item 3] – _[Rationale]_  
4. [Action Item 4] – _[Rationale]_  
5. [Action Item 5] – _[Rationale]_
[[Template Ends]]

4. Keep only modified template in your response without surrounding [[Template Begins]] and [[Template Ends]].

5. Use `all_data` and Create a Slack-ready morning brief including Urgent follow-ups using the following template:

[Template Begins]

---

🚨 **Urgent Follow-Ups**  
- [Email/Task/Thread]: _[Reason it’s urgent]_  
- [Email/Task/Thread]: _[Reason it’s urgent]_

6. Keep only modified template in your response without surrounding [[Template Begins]] and [[Template Ends]].
